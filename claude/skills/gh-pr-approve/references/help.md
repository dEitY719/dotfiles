# gh:pr-approve — Help

## Arguments

| # | Name | Default | Description |
|---|------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | PR number, or `-h`/`--help`/`help` | required unless current branch has a PR | Target PR, e.g. `99` |
| 2 | remote name | `origin` | Git remote for the target repo |

### Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--self-ok` | Skip the self-review pre-flight stop (`author.login == ME`). Use when another AI agent authored the PR or when no human reviewer is available. Other stop conditions (draft, conflicting, failing checks) still apply. The bypass is recorded in the review body for audit. |

## Usage

- `/gh-pr-approve 99` — review PR #99 on `origin`
- `/gh-pr-approve 99 upstream` — PR #99 on `upstream`'s repo
- `/gh-pr-approve` — review the PR open on the current branch
- `/gh-pr-approve 99 --self-ok` — review PR #99 even though you authored it (multi-AI workflow / no human reviewer)
- `/gh-pr-approve -h` / `--help` / `help` — print this help

## What the skill does

1. Pre-flight gate — checks PR state, draft, author, merge conflicts, required CI.
   Stops early on any blocker (won't approve your own PR, can't approve a draft, etc.).
2. Fetches diff, commits, and all three comment endpoints (inline / issue / review).
3. Reviews against `references/review-criteria.md` — correctness, conventions, security,
   performance, tests. If you previously reviewed this PR, enters re-review mode and
   verifies every prior concern was addressed.
4. Classifies findings as BLOCKER, FOLLOW-UP, or PRAISE.
5. Submits the review:
   - 0 BLOCKER, 0 FOLLOW-UP → **Approve with LGTM 👍** + specific compliments.
   - 0 BLOCKER, ≥1 FOLLOW-UP → files each follow-up as a GitHub issue, posts one PR
     comment linking them, then approves. Keeps the AI-driven issue workflow intact.
   - ≥1 BLOCKER → **Request changes** with per-blocker file:line pointers. Blockers
     stay on the PR so the author's next push triggers natural re-review.
6. Re-fetches `reviewDecision` + `mergeStateStatus` and reports a compact summary
   (plus diagnosis if merge is still blocked for reasons outside your review).

## What the skill won't do

- Approve your own PR (unless `--self-ok` is given — see Flags above).
- Approve without reading the diff.
- Merge the PR (author decides).
- Create follow-up issues for trivia that don't justify a tracked item.
- Attach labels/milestones to follow-up issues unless the label already exists in the repo.
