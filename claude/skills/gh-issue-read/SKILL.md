name: gh:issue-read
description: >-
  Fetch a GitHub issue by number and print a structured, human-readable
  summary without modifying it. Use when the user runs /gh:issue-read,
  /gh-issue-read, or asks "이슈 #N 읽고 정리해줘", "issue 42 뭐하는 거야",
  "#16 요약", "이 이슈 내용 파악". Preserves body and comments verbatim
  so the output can be reused as context for implementation work. Accepts
  `<issue-number> [remote]`; defaults remote to `origin`. Accepts
  `-h`/`--help`/`help` to print usage.

# gh:issue-read — Issue Summary

## Help

If arg #1 is `-h`, `--help`, or `help`, read `references/help.md` and
output its content verbatim, then stop. No API calls.

## Role

Fetch a single GitHub issue and print a structured summary. Read-only —
never mutate the issue. Preserve body + comments verbatim so the output
feeds downstream skills (like `gh:issue-implement`).

## Step 1: Parse Args + Resolve Repo

Positional args: `<issue-number> [remote]`.

- `issue-number` — required, positive integer. Missing/invalid → print
  usage pointer (`Run /gh-issue-read -h for usage.`) and stop.
- `remote` — default `origin`. Resolve `TARGET_REPO=<owner>/<repo>` via
  `git remote get-url <remote>`. Missing remote → list `git remote -v`
  and stop.

Substeps and error templates in `references/repo-resolution.md`.

## Step 2: Fetch Issue

```bash
gh issue view <N> --repo "$TARGET_REPO" --json \
  number,title,body,author,labels,state,stateReason,\
  comments,assignees,createdAt,updatedAt,url
```

On error (issue not found, auth failure), print `gh` stderr verbatim
and stop — do not attempt fallback.

## Step 3: Format Output

Assemble the output per `references/output-format.md`. Sections:
Header → Summary → Body → Discussion → Meta → Checklist.

- **Body** and **Discussion** are verbatim. Do NOT compress, do NOT
  rewrap, do NOT translate.
- **Summary** is your 2-4 line extraction of the ask.
- **Checklist** pulls every `- [ ]` / `- [x]` line from body + comments.
- Match the user's conversation language for section headers
  (`Summary` vs `요약` etc.) but keep content verbatim.

## Step 4: Report

Print the formatted output directly. No preamble ("Here's the issue..."),
no trailing summary ("Let me know if you want..."). The output IS the
deliverable.

## Constraints

- Read-only — never call `gh issue edit`, `close`, or `comment`.
- Never fall back to `origin` when a non-existent remote is passed.
- Never truncate or paraphrase body/comments — the point is preservation.
- Never assume English; match the issue's language in body/comments and
  the user's conversation language for section headers.
