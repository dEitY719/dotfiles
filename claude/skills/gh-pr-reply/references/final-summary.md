# Final Summary — output table printed by `gh:pr-reply` Step 7

Print a table the user can scan after all replies are posted:

```
PR #123 review comments processed: 5 total
  Accepted: 3 (commits abc1234, def5678)
  Declined: 1
  Answered: 1
  -> All comments replied to.
```

## Required fields

- **Total** — count of comments identified in Step 2 (after dedup).
- **Accepted** — count + the commit short-SHAs that landed the fixes.
- **Declined** — count of comments classified DECLINE.
- **Answered** — count of comments classified QUESTION.
- **Closing line** — `-> All comments replied to.` confirms the
  politeness contract was met.

## Optional appendix

If any comments were skipped as "already replied", list them at the
bottom under a `Skipped (already replied):` header with the comment IDs
or short bodies, so the user can verify nothing was silently ignored.
