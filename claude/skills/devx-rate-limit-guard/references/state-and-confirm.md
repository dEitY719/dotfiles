# State File Schema + Confirm Output Template

Single source of truth for `.claude/.rate-limit-guard.json` and the
Step 5 user-facing confirm block. Both `devx:rate-limit-guard` (Steps
4–5) and `devx:resume-after-limit` (`../../devx-resume-after-limit/references/preemptive-rearm.md`) read from
this file — change the schema here and only here.

## State file: `.claude/.rate-limit-guard.json`

Location: worktree root. One JSON object per line — written compact so
it round-trips through `cat | jq` without reformat noise.

```json
{"cron_id":"<id>","command":"<command>","worktree":"<PWD_NOW>","branch":"<BRANCH>","scheduled_for":"<ISO>","max_cycles":<N>,"cycles_remaining":<N>,"cycle_window_min":<M>}
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| `cron_id` | string | ID returned by the most recent `CronCreate`. Used by Step 6 cleanup and by `resume-after-limit` re-arm. |
| `command` | string | Original wrapped command (verbatim, quoting preserved). Replayed unchanged on every cycle. |
| `worktree` | string | Absolute path captured at registration (`PWD_NOW`). `resume-after-limit` refuses to fire from a different worktree. |
| `branch` | string | Feature branch captured at registration. Sanity check only. |
| `scheduled_for` | string (ISO 8601) | Local fire time of the *current* cron — updated each re-arm. |
| `max_cycles` | int ≥ 1 | Total cycles requested via `--max-cycles N` (default 1). Constant for the lifetime of the state file. |
| `cycles_remaining` | int 0..N | Starts at `max_cycles`; `resume-after-limit` decrements by 1 every time it pre-emptively re-arms. |
| `cycle_window_min` | int ≥ 1 | Minutes between fires for cycles 2..N (`--cycle-window M`, default 305). |

Invariants: `0 ≤ cycles_remaining ≤ max_cycles`; the state file exists
iff a guard cron is currently scheduled. Step 6 deletes the file on
clean completion.

## Step 5 confirm output template

Printed verbatim after Step 4 succeeds. The `<HH:MM + 5min>` shows the
reset time plus the constant 5-minute margin.
