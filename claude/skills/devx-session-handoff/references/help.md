# devx:session-handoff — Help

## Usage

```
/devx:session-handoff                    # auto-resolve tracking issue, post handoff
/devx:session-handoff 1767               # explicit issue number
/devx:session-handoff 1767 upstream      # explicit issue + remote
/devx:session-handoff --memory-only      # skip the issue comment, memory only
/devx:session-handoff --new-issue        # force a new tracking issue
/devx:session-handoff -h                 # show this help
/devx:session-handoff --help             # show this help
/devx:session-handoff help               # show this help
```

## What it does

When a long task is about to outlive the current session (context window
near its limit, end of day, planned interruption), this skill writes the
handoff so the next session can resume without re-explaining:

1. Resolves the tracking issue (arg → conversation → branch → gh activity;
   creates one via gh:issue-create when the work deserves it, or falls back
   to memory-only when it doesn't).
2. Composes a structured handoff comment — verified done / remaining work /
   resume environment / open decisions — and posts it on the issue.
3. Updates auto-memory with the same resume state (issue = team-visible,
   memory = agent-local).
4. Prints a one-line copy-paste resume sentence, e.g. `#1767 P5b 진행`.

## When to invoke

- The context window is approaching its limit mid-task.
- You are stopping for the day but the work continues tomorrow.
- You want the next session (or a teammate) to pick up exactly where this
  one stopped.

Do NOT invoke for:

- Recording a finished one-off task — that's gh:issue-create or
  gh:discussion-create.
- Resuming after an API error or ESC in the SAME session — that's
  devx:restart.
- Auto-resuming after a token-limit reset via cron — that's
  devx:resume-after-limit (this skill writes the handoff those resumers
  consume).

## Honesty rules

- Only merged PRs and tests that ran green in this session are listed as
  "완료 (검증됨)".
- Unverified edits are labeled 미검증 — never rounded up to done.
- The resume sentence must map to the real tracking issue and its actual
  next step.

## Constraints

- Writes exactly two artifacts: one issue comment (skippable with
  `--memory-only`) and one memory file. No commits, pushes, code edits, or
  issue state changes.
- Duplicate guard: a handoff comment already posted from this session is
  updated in place, not appended.
